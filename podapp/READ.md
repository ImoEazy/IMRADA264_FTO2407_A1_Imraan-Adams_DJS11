PODCAST APPLICATION.

This is a my podcast application called "Podapp". It is a fullstack web application focused around framework tailwind CSS and libraries react.jsx, vite. Using React provides a collection of tools, including components and functions, without enforcing strict rules or structures for building the application.One of the main advantages of React being a library is the flexibility it offers. One is free to choose the tools and libraries needed to use alongside React like incorporating Tailwind CSS. For making network requests, It also uses choice 'Fetch' API and also has'Axios' installed.

Regarding the podacst appliication I used Tailwind CCS (a utility first framework) to style the application. tailwindcss provides a set of pre-built CSS classes, meaning one does not have to write repetitive CSS for different elements, thus reducing CSS bundle size.I installed and applied tailwindcss styling with PostCSS.config.js which functions as a plugin tool to supporting changes in the browser.
My podcast application intergration is set up using  'npm create react router dom" in addition the command 'npm run build' is used to set up the build folder "dist".

My app is compromised of 'components, context, hooks, pages and utils folder'. The API Data is pulled through within the "usePodcast.js" file within the hooks folder.
